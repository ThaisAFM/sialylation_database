# First, you'll need to extract the gene IDs from each genome:

p3-echo <product_name> | p3-find-features product > <gene>_ids.txt
# Replace product_name with the product name of interest, and gene with the desired name for the file where the IDs will be saved


# Then extract the sequences for the IDs with p3-get-feature-sequence: 

p3-get-feature-sequence --input <gene>_ids.txt --col 2 > <gene>.fasta
# Replace gene_ids.txt with the folder name that contains the ID list, and gene with the desired name for the file where the sequences will be saved
