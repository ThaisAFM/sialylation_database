# Sialylation database
This repository outlines the steps and associated scripts involved in setting up a database of curated protein sequences for bacterial sialylation pathways. 

1. Sequence download: sequence_downloads (folder)

2. Removal of redundancy within individual databases: CDHIT_within_databases.sh

3. Local execution of InterProScan: interproscan.sh

4. Essential signature filtering and exclusion of sequences with inadequate signatures: signatures_comparison.ipynb

5. Recoding
